I am a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya.

Passion about problem-solving is what got me into code, being able to come up with creative solutions is what makes me stay.

I enjoy learning as much as I enjoy teaching, I think both are equally fulfilling activities to me, and when I look for a job, continuous learning is a priority.

I am good at React JS, Python Flask, Spring boot, Modern Javascript, Java, Python, HTML5, CSS3, REST, Graphql and I constantly work on improving my skills and learning new Technologies

I spend most of my time coding and contributing to discussions in tech communities, if I am not doing that, I am out meeting friends and family.
